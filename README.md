# Idiot

This is just a super simple 'virus' for trolling Windows users.
It is just a joke! It does not do anything harmful, it just displays a lot of windows, and that's all.

This is desktop (Win32) version of this joke, originally it appeared at <http://youareanidiot.org>, but it was removed later. You can still see the original version on Web Archive: <https://web.archive.org/web/20040804124508/http://www.youareanidiot.org/>. To try it, you need to enable Flash player and disable Pop-up Blocker.
